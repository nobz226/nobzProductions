                <h3>What started it all?</h3>
                    <p>The idea of creating something cool and beautiful with my computer stems from my love of urban
                        culture and all of it's many branches, grafitti, hip-hop, extreme sports, underground bands, nu-metal and 
                        all the fashion and aesthetics that come with it. I first fell in love with computers and then discovered 
                        a whole new world through skateboarding and music.</p>
                     
                    <p>I wanted to give so much back to these worlds and 25 years later, I still hold the same love for all of those things. 
                        In 2019 I started my digital creative identity by making hip hop beats and today I am dabbling in photography, 
                        web development, graphic design and so much more.</p>
                     
                <h3>Mission</h3>
                    <p>My goal is to provide inspiration for digital creatives and music creators while sharing my own journey
                        through beatmaking, photography and graphic design. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn production,
                        a DJ needing quick track, or just someone who loves urban art, I hope you find something here to help enhance your 
                        experience. - Eddie (Nobz)</p>
