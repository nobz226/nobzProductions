            <h2>Browse through a selection of home made beats and remixes</h2>
            <p>This is a selection of beats from my journey through beatmaking and music production.<br>
                These tracks were made using a mixture of MIDI, real live played and recorded instruments,
                sample chops and turntablism.<br> 
                Everything was done with Native Instruments Maschine, Ableton and the trusty Technics Sl-1200. Shout out!
